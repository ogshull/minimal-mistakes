My name is Gabi and I was born and raised in New York City. I am a biomedical engineering PhD student working in neural engineering to create electrode arrays for brain computer interfacing. I am also an avid programmer, and follow the blockhain/cryptocurrency world closely. My hobbies include operating my bitcoin mining farm (Hive Mine LLC), playing guitar/piano, exercising, and reading.
