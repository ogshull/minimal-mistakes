My name is Gabi and I was born and raised in New York City. I am currently a biomedical engineering PhD student working in neural engineering to create electrode arrays for brain computer interfacing. My hobbies include operating my bitcoin mining farm, Hive Mine LLC, playing guitar/piano, exercising, and reading.
